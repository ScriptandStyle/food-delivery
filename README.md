# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Running the Full-Stack Application

To run the full-stack application, you need to start both the frontend and backend servers.

### Backend Setup

1. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

2. Configure MongoDB:
   - Open MongoDB Compass
   - Connect to your local MongoDB instance (typically `mongodb://localhost:27017`)
   - Create a database named `food_delvi`

3. Set up environment variables:
   - The backend uses a `.env` file with the following variables:
     - `PORT=5000` - The port the server will run on
     - `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/food_delvi` - MongoDB connection string
     - `JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here` - Secret key for JWT tokens
     - `JWT_EXPIRE=30d` - JWT token expiration time
   - **Important**: Change the `JWT_SECRET` to a secure random string

4. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend server will start on port 5000.

### Frontend Setup

1. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will start on port 3000 and automatically open in your browser.
